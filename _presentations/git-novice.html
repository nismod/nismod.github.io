# 1. Concepts

Questions:
- What is version control and why should I use it?

Objectives:
- Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.
- Understand the basics of how Git works.

Keypoints:
- Version control is like an unlimited 'undo'.
- Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.

## Sequential changes (_commits_)

*   Version control systems start with a base version of a document
*   They record a sequence of changes to this document

![Changes Are Saved Sequentially](../fig/play-changes.svg)

*   Each change is recorded as a `commit`
*   At any point, you can rewind - **undo** - or pick and choose which changes
    to keep

???

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can
think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base
document, then you can play back each change and end up with your
latest version.

---

## Concurrent changes (_branches_)

*  You can make independent sets of changes based on the
    same document

![Different Versions Can be Saved](../fig/versions.svg)

*   These result in the creation of a `branch`
*   Branches let you take risks

???

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the
base document and getting different versions of the document. For
example, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the
same document.

---

## Compiling a version (_merging_)

* Version control keeps track of different `branches`
* It also helps us `merge` different branches to make one master version

![Multiple Versions Can be Merged](../fig/merge.svg)

???

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and
helps us version and merge our files. It allows you to
decide which changes make up the next version, called a
[commit]({{ page.root }}/reference/#commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The
complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up
a [repository]({{ page.root }}/reference/#repository). Repositories can be kept in sync
across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.

---

## A project keeps all changes in a _repository_

* The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up
a `repository`
* Git requires a two step process
    * `git add` to add files to a staging area
    * `git commit` to write this commit to the repository

![Stage changes to a repository](../fig/git-staging-area.svg)

## Note

* At no point are we copying files around
* We just record which changes have been made since the last commit

???

## The Long History of Version Control Systems

Automated version control systems are nothing new.
Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies.
However, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities.
In particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/)
are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.
These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within
the same files concurrently.

---

## Exercise: Paper Writing

*   Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve
    the *excellent* version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?
*   Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper?
    If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the
    `Track Changes` option? Do you have a history of those changes?

---

## Exercise: System of Systems National Infrastructure Modelling

*   Imagine you're part of a 
    research project to model national infrastructure systems over the next
    50-100 years. How would you approach developing a suite of models in
    parallel?
*   How might a history of the development process be useful?
*   How could you manage the development and integration of various models?

---

## Summary

Two main concepts:

*   A `commit` is a package of changes made to some files
*   A `repository` is a store of all the commits for a project

# 2. Setting Up Git

Questions:
- How do I get set up to use Git?

Objectives:
- Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer.
- Understand the meaning of the `--global` configuration flag.

Keypoints:
- Use `git config` to configure a user name, email address, editor, and other preferences once per machine.

---

## Git config

So here is how Dracula sets up his new laptop:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
git config --global color.ui "auto"
```

* Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's
* This should be the same e-mail you used to sign up to Github

???

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do.

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   to colorize our output,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)

--

![Bela Lugosi as Dracula](../fig/dracula.jpg)

???

This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](http://github.com/),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.
If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy].

---

## Text editor for git commit messages

Pick a text editor to use (we'll use `nano` for the rest of this presentation):

| Editor | Configuration command                          |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| nano               | `git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| vim                | `git config --global core.editor "vim"`        |


???

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

## Exiting Vim

Note that `vim` is the default editor for for many programs, if you haven't used `vim` before and wish to exit a session, type `Esc` then `:q!` and `Enter`.

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: just use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

---

## Line endings

Windows and Mac/Linux handle line endings differently, and we want to be able to
share files between operating systems.

Git has a setting that _should_ let us set a sensible default.

On Windows, set it to `true`:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

On Mac or Linux, set it to `input`:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

---

## Checking config

You can check your settings at any time:

```bash
git config --list
```

## Git Help and Manual

```bash
git config -h
git config --help
```

- [cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

Always remember that if you forget a git command, you can access the list of command by using -h and access the git manual by using --help :

## Summary

* Use `git config` to setup configuration before using git on a new computer
* You only need to do this once

# 3. Creating a Repository

Questions:
- Where does Git store information?

Objectives:
- Create a local Git repository.

Keypoints:
- `git init` initializes a repository.

---

## Starting a project

Imagine we're starting a new project to establish a space base, possibly on
mars.

Let's move to our home directory, create a directory for our work and then move into that directory:

```bash
cd
mkdir planets
cd planets
```

## Note

Your 'home directory' on Windows is something like `C:\Users\Dracula\`

On Mac or Linux it is more like `/home/dracula/` or, generally, `~` for short

???

Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository]({{ page.root }}/reference/#repository)—a place where
Git can store versions of our files:

---

Make a git repository!

```bash
git init
```

--

Look to see if any files were added:

```bash
ls
```

--

What about hidden files or folders?

```bash
ls -A
```

--

```
.git
```

--

We could ask for more detail from `ls`:

```bash
ls -A -l
```

--

```
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 1 dracula 1049089 0 Oct   5 15:00 .git/
```

???

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

---

Let's ask Git to tell us the status of our project:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

???

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking git for a status update

---

## Exercise: Places to Create Git Repositories

Think about starting a new project, `moons`, related to our `planets` project.

```bash
cd             # return to home directory
mkdir planets  # make a new directory planets
cd planets     # go into planets
git init       # make the planets directory a Git repository
mkdir moons    # make a sub-directory planets/moons
cd moons       # go into planets/moons
git init       # make the moons sub-directory a Git repository
```

Why might it be a bad idea to do this?

How can we undo the last `git init`?

## Note

The commands above make the following directory structure:

```
~/planets
~/planets/.git
~/planets/moons
~/planets/moons/.git
```

---

## Summary

Use `git init` to initialise a repository
---
# 4. Tracking Changes

Questions:
- How do I record changes in Git, and notes about my changes?
- How do I check the status of my version control repository?

Objectives:
- Explain where information is stored at each stage of Git commit workflow.

Keypoints:
- `git status` shows the status of a repository.
- Files can be stored in a project's working directory, the staging area and the local repository.
- `git add` puts files in the staging area.
- `git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository.

---

## Here's what we are going to do...

![The Git Commit Workflow](../fig/git-staging-area.svg)

1.   Create a file
2.   `git add` to stage the file
3.   `git commit` to commit to the repository

---

## Let's do it...

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.

```bash
nano mars.txt
```

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite colour
```

???

(We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier.)

---


`mars.txt` now contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```bash
ls
```

--

```
mars.txt
```

--

```bash
cat mars.txt
```

--

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite colour
```

---

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

???

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.

---

We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```bash
git add mars.txt
```

and then check that the right thing happened:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt

```

???

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.


---

Then we can record these changes as a commit:

```bash
git commit
```

This should open the text editor we configured earlier.

Type a commit message:

```
Start notes on Mars as a base
```


Then save it, and close the message file in the editor.

--

```
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
```

--

If we run `git status` now:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

???
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command, `git commit`.

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit]({{ page.root }}/reference/#commit)
(or [revision]({{ page.root }}/reference/#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`
(Your commit may have another identifier.)

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit.  If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.

Then run git status again,
it tells us everything is up to date.

---

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```bash
git log
```

--

```
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
```

???

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

## Where Are My Changes?

If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
That's because Git saves information about files' history
in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
(and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).

---

Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

--

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite colour
The two moons may be a problem for werewolves
```

--

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

???

(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now.

---

What changed?

```bash
git diff
```

--

```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@

+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```

???

It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:


The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.


---
After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```bash
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on werewolves"
git status
```

Note: `git commit -m` lets us write a short message for the commit right on the
command line, without opening a separate text editor.

--

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

--

Whoops! Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.

--

```bash
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on werewolves"
```

--

```
[master 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on werewolves
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

???

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
but *not* commit the work we're doing on the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [change set]({{ page.root }}/reference/#change-set)
but not yet committed.

---

Let's run through the process again, from (1) making a change in the working
directory to (2) the staging area, to (3) commiting.

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However, if we add the `--staged` flag...

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

## Staging Area

If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
`git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
(putting things in the staging area),
and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and
makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`,
Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`,
which is kind of like gathering *everyone* for the picture!
However, it's almost always better to
explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to snapshots,
you might get the extra with incomplete makeup walking on
the stage for the snapshot because you used `-a`!)
Try to stage things manually,
or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more
than you would like!

![The Git Staging Area](../fig/git-staging-area.svg)

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

it shows us the difference between
the last committed change
and what's in the staging area.

---

And finally, committing:

```bash
git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"
```

--

```
[master 005937f] Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

--

Check our status:

```bash
git status

--

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

--

All done!

## Paging the Log

When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen,
`git` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen.
When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your
screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.

*   To get out of the pager, press `q`.
*   To move to the next page, press the space bar.
*   To search for `some_word` in all pages, type `/some_word`
    and navigate throught matches pressing `n`.

???

## Limit Log Size

To avoid that `git log` cover all your terminal screen you can
limit the numbers of commit that Git will list by using `-N`
where `N` is the number of commits that you want to receive
the information. For example, if you only want the information
from the last commit you can use

--

Or ask for less information:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

--

```
* 005937f Thoughts about the climate
* 34961b1 Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend
* f22b25e Starting to think about Mars
```

???

Or try lots more options:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
```

```
* 005937f Thoughts about the climate (HEAD, master)
* 34961b1 Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend
* f22b25e Starting to think about Mars
```

???

## Minimum info

 You can also reduce the quantity of information using the
`--oneline` option:

You can also combine the `--oneline` options with others. One useful
combination is

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

## Recap: Modify, Stage, Commit

![The Git Commit Workflow](../fig/git-committing.svg)

---

## Exercise: Choosing a Commit Message
Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
last commit made to `mars.txt`?

1. "Changes"
2. "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt"
3. "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"

--

## Suggested solution
Answer 1 is not descriptive enough,
and answer 2 is too descriptive and redundant,
but answer 3 is good: short but descriptive.

With larger changes, more detail might be helpful - commit messages
often have a short first line to summarise the change, and any further
details can be written as necessary.

---

## Exercise: Committing Changes to Git
Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
to my local Git repository?
1. `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
2. `git init myfile.txt`<br>`git commit -m "my recent changes"`
3. `git add myfile.txt`<br>`git commit -m "my recent changes"`
4. `git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"`

--

## Solution
1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
2. Would try to create a new repository.
3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.

---

## Exercise: Committing Multiple Files
The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1. Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision
to consider Venus as a base
2. Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts
about Venus as a base for you and your friends
3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
and commit those changes.

---

## Solution

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```
Maybe I should start with a base on Venus.
```

```bash
nano venus.txt
cat venus.txt
```

```
Venus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.
```

---

Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:

```bash
git add mars.txt venus.txt
```

Or with multiple commands:

```bash
git add mars.txt
git add venus.txt
```

--

Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:

```bash
git commit -m "Wrote down my plans to start a base on Venus"
```

--

```
[master cc127c2]
Wrote down my plans to start a base on venus
2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

???

`git commit --author="Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>"`

For each of the commits you have done, Git stored your name twice.
You are named as the author and as the committer. You can observe
that by telling Git to show you more information about your last
commits:

---

## Summary

- `git status` shows the status of a repository.
- Files can be stored in a project's working directory, the staging area and the local repository.
- `git add` puts files in the staging area.
- `git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository.

# 5. Exploring History

Questions:
- How can I identify old versions of files?
- How do I review my changes?
- How can I recover old versions of files?

Objectives:
- Explain what the HEAD of a repository is and how to use it.
- Compare various versions of tracked files.
- Restore old versions of files.

Keypoints:
- `git diff` displays differences between commits.
- `git checkout` recovers old versions of files.

Let's make another small change:

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity

???

As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`.

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).

---

What about looking further back in time?

```bash
git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```

The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

If we want to see what we changed at different steps, we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to old
commits.

git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt

???

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits.

The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

---

We can refer to commits by id:

```bash
git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt

???

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
so let's try this:


That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters.

---

Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```
We will need to manufacture our own oxygen
```

--

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

???

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed—now how
can we restore older versions of things?

---

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```bash
git checkout HEAD mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

--

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```

--

To go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:

```bash
git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

???

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.

---

## Note: Don't Lose Your HEAD

Above we used

```bash
git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

to revert mars.txt to its state after the commit f22b25e.

If you forget `mars.txt` in that command, Git will tell you that `You are in
'detached HEAD' state.`

In this state, you shouldn't make any changes.

You can fix this by reattaching your head using `git checkout master`

---

Remember to use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.

![Git Checkout](../fig/git-checkout.svg)

???

A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

---

## Simplifying the Common Case

If you read the output of `git status` carefully,
you'll see that it includes this hint:

```
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
```

Try deleting a file:

```bash
rm mars.txt
ls
```

--

Then put it back:

```bash
git checkout -- mars.txt
```

???

As it says,
`git checkout` without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in `HEAD`.
The double dash `--` is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered
from the command itself:
without it,
Git would try to use the name of the file as the commit identifier.


The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

---

## Explore and Summarize Histories

Recorded that the `git diff` command allow us to explore one specific file,
e.g. `git diff mars.txt`. We can apply the similar idea here.

```bash
git log mars.txt
```

--

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize different part of the history for you.
Is that possible to combine both? Let's try the following:

```bash
git log --patch mars.txt
```

--

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit
messages and the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

```bash
git log --patch HEAD~3 HEAD~1 *.txt
```

???

Exploring history is an important part of git, often it is a challenge to find
the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.

Imaging the `planets` project has more than 50 files.
You would like to find a commit with specific text in `mars.txt` is modified.
When you type `git log`, a very long list appeared,
How can you narrow down the search?

---

## Exercise: Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the
modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent
~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will
let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called
`data_cruncher.py`?

1. `$ git checkout HEAD`
2. `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`
3. `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`
4. `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`
5. Both 2 and 4

---

## Exercise: Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating on her Python script with her colleagues and
realises her last commit to the group repository is wrong and wants to
undo it.  Jennifer needs to undo correctly so everyone in the group
repository gets the correct change.

`git revert [wrong commit ID]` will make a new commit that undoes Jennifer's
previous commit. Below are the right steps and explanations for
Jennifer to use `git revert`. The first step is to look at the git history of
the project to find the commit ID

What is the missing command?

1. ...
2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).
3. `git revert [commit ID]`
4. Type in the new commit message.
5. Save and close


---

## Exercise: Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of `cat venus.txt` at the end of this set of commands?

```bash
cd planets
nano venus.txt # add text: Venus is beautiful and full of love
git add venus.txt
nano venus.txt # add text: Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base
git commit -m "comments on Venus as an unsuitable base"
git checkout HEAD venus.txt
cat venus.txt # print the contents of venus.txt to the screen
```

1. `Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base`
2. `Venus is beautiful and full of love`
3. Both lines: <br>`Venus is beautiful and full of love`<br>`Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base`
4. Error because you have changed venus.txt without committing the changes

---

## Exercise: Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt`. What do you predict this command
will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] mars.txt`, where [ID] is replaced with
the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen,
and what does happen?


---

## Exercise: Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have
been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?

Make a change to `mars.txt`, `git add` that change, and use `git checkout` to see if
you can remove your change.

(Hint: read the output of `git status` after you've staged the change)

---

## Summary

- `git log` shows the history as a list of commits.
- `git diff` displays differences between commits.
- `git checkout` recovers old versions of files.

# 6. Ignoring Things

Questions:
- How can I tell Git to ignore files I don't want to track?

Objectives:
- Configure Git to ignore specific files.
- Explain why ignoring files can be useful.

Keypoints:
- The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore.

---

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis.
Let's create a few dummy files:

```bash
mkdir results
touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
```

and see what Git says:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.dat
	b.dat
	c.dat
	results/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

```bash
nano .gitignore
cat .gitignore
```

--

```
*.dat
results/
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.

(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

---

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

```bash
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add the ignore file"
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

---

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don't want to track:

```bash
git add a.dat
```

--

```
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example,
`git add -f a.dat`.

---

We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

```bash
git status --ignored
```

--

```
On branch master
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.dat
        b.dat
        c.dat
        results/

nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

---

## Exercise: Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

```
results/data
results/plots
```

How would you ignore only `results/plots` and not `results/data`?

--

## Solution

As with most programming issues, there are a few ways that you
could solve this. If you only want to ignore the contents of
`results/plots`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore
only the `/plots/` subfolder by adding the following line to
your .gitignore:

`results/plots/`

???

If, instead, you want to ignore everything in `/results/`, but wanted to track
`results/data`, then you can add `results/` to your .gitignore
and create an exception for the `results/data/` folder.
The next challenge will cover this type of solution.

---

## Exercise: Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.data` files in your root directory except for
`final.data`?
Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

--

## Solution

You would add the following two lines to your .gitignore:

```
*.data           # ignore all data files
!final.data      # except final.data
```

The exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.

---

## Exercise: Ignoring all Data Files in a Directory

Given a directory structure that looks like:

```
results/data/position/gps/a.data
results/data/position/gps/b.data
results/data/position/gps/c.data
results/data/position/gps/info.txt
results/plots
```

What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all `.data`
files in `result/data/position/gps`? Do not ignore the `info.txt`.

--

## Solution

Appending `results/data/position/gps/*.data` will match every file in `results/data/position/gps` that ends with `.data`.
The file `results/data/position/gps/info.txt` will not be ignored.

---

## Exercise: The Order of Rules

Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

```
*.data
!*.data
```

What will be the result?

--

## Solution

The `!` modifier will negate an entry from a previously defined ignore pattern.
Because the `!*.data` entry negates all of the previous `.data` files in the `.gitignore`,
none of them will be ignored, and all `.data` files will be tracked.

---

## Exercise: Log Files

You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc.
You want to keep them but you do not want to track them through `git`.

1. Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.
2. Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form `log_01`, etc.
3. You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.
4. Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude via `.gitignore`.

--

## Solution

1. append either `log_*`  or  `log*`  as a new entry in your .gitignore
3. track `log_01` using   `git add -f log_01`

---

## Summary

- Do use version control for all your source code
- Don't include data or generated files
- The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore
---
# 7. Remotes in GitHub

Questions:
- How do I share my changes with others on the web?

Objectives:
- Explain what remote repositories are and why they are useful.
- Push to or pull from a remote repository.

Keypoints:
- A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.
- Use the HTTPS protocol to connect to remote repositories until you have learned how to set up SSH.
- `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
- `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.

---

## Collaborating using Github

- Version control is really great to collaborate with other people.

We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

- [GitHub](http://github.com) is used as a central hub for collaboration using Git.

???

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](http://github.com), [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies; we'll explore the pros
and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.

---

## Share our current project with the world

* Log in to GitHub,
* click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `planets`

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](../fig/github-create-repo-01.png)

---

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository":

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](../fig/github-create-repo-02.png)

---

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](../fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

---

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

```bash
mkdir planets
cd planets
git init
```
---

Our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any files yet:

![Freshly-Made GitHub Repository](../fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg)

---

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote]({{ page.root }}/reference/#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-find-repo-string.png)

Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the [protocol]({{ page.root }}/reference/#protocol) from
SSH to HTTPS.

## HTTPS vs. SSH

We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.  After
the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by
following one of the great tutorials from
[GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
[Atlassian/BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git)
and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/)
(this one has a screencast).

---

![Changing the Repository URL on GitHub](../fig/github-change-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `planets` repository, and run
this command:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only
difference should be your username instead of `vlad`.

---

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

```bash
git remote -v
```

--

```
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
```

---

The name `origin` is a local nickname for your remote repository: we could use
something else if we wanted to, but `origin` is by far the most common choice.

Once the nickname `origin` is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

--

```
Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
```

???

## Password Managers

If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will
try to use it when it needs your username and password.  For example, this
is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your
username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager,
type:

```bash
unset SSH_ASKPASS
```

in the terminal, before you run `git push`.  Despite the name, [git uses
`SSH_ASKPASS` for all credential
entry](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials), so
you may want to unset `SSH_ASKPASS` whether you are using git via SSH or
https.

You may also want to add `unset SSH_ASKPASS` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`
to make git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords. -->

---

Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

![GitHub Repository After First Push](../fig/github-repo-after-first-push.svg)

???

## The '-u' Flag

You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.  It is
related to concepts we cover in our intermediate lesson, and can safely be
ignored for now.

---

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

--

```
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

---

## Practice: GitHub GUI

Logs:

* Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub.
* Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "3 commits" (where "3" might be a different number!).
* Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
* What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
* How would you get that same information in the shell?

## Practice: GitHub Timestamp

Create a remote repository on GitHub.  Push the contents of your local
repository to the remote.  Make changes to your local repository and push
these changes.

Go to the repo you just created on Github and check the
[timestamps]({{ page.root }}/reference/#timestamp) of the files.

How does GitHub record times, and why?

---

## Discuss: Push vs. Commit

In this lesson, we introduced the `git push` command.
How is `git push` different from `git commit`?


---

## Exercise: Fixing Remote Settings

It happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the
remote URL. This exercise is about how to fix this kind of issue.
First start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:

```bash
git remote add broken https://github.com/this/url/is/invalid
```

Do you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a
command that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not
valid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use `git remote
-h`)? Don't forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are
done with this exercise.

---

## Discuss: GitHub License and README files

In this section we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but
when you initialized your GitHub repo, you didn't add a README.md or a license
file.

If you had, what do you think would have happened when you tried to link your
local and remote repositories?

---

## Summary

- A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.
- Use the HTTPS protocol to connect to remote repositories until you have learned how to set up SSH.
- `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
- `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git` adds a reference in a local repository to a remote repository

# 8. Collaborating

Questions:
- How can I use version control to collaborate with other people?

Objectives:
- Clone a remote repository.
- Collaborate pushing to a common repository.

Keypoints:
- `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called `origin` automatically set up.

---

## Setup in Pairs

* The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.
* On GitHub
    * click the _Settings_ button on the right of the screen,
    * then select _Collaborators_  and enter your partner's username.

![Adding Collaborators on GitHub](../fig/github-add-collaborators.png)

To accept access to the Owner's repo, the Collaborator
needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).
Once there she can accept access to the Owner's repo.

???

* For the next step, get into pairs.
* One person will be the "Owner" and the other
will be the "Collaborator".
* The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into
the Owner's repository.
* We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will
play Owner and Collaborator.

---

## Cloning a repository

Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to her
 machine. This is called "cloning a repo". To clone the Owner's repo into
her `Desktop` folder, the Collaborator enters:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git ~/Desktop/vlad-planets
```

Replace `vlad` with the Owner's username.

---

<img alt="After Creating Clone of Repository" src="../fig/github-collaboration.svg" style="width: 80%;" />

---

The Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,
exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/vlad-planets
nano pluto.txt
cat pluto.txt
```

```
It is so a planet!
```

--

```bash
git add pluto.txt
git commit -m "Some notes about Pluto"
```

```
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
```

---

Then push the change to the Owner's repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

```
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -master
```

Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`: Git uses this
name by default when we clone a repository.  (This is why `origin` was a
sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

---

Take a look to the Owner's repository on its GitHub website now (maybe you need
to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the
Collaborator.

To download the Collaborator's changes from GitHub, the Owner now enters:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

```
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -FETCH_HEAD
Updating 9272da5..29aba7c
Fast-forward
 pluto.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
```

Now the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on
GitHub) are back in sync.

---

## A Basic Collaborative Workflow

In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the
repository you are collaborating on, so you should `git pull` before making
our changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:

* update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
* make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
* commit your changes with `git commit -m`
* upload the changes to GitHub with `git push origin master`

It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than
of one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to
read and review.


## Switch Roles and Repeat

Switch roles and repeat the whole process.

---

## Discuss: Review Changes

The Owner pushes commits to the repository without giving any information
to the Collaborator.

How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with
command line?

How can they find out what changed on GitHub?

---

## Exercise: Comment Changes in GitHub

The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and
has some suggestions to propose.

With GitHub, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of
code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.

The Collaborator posts their comments and suggestions using the GitHub interface.

---

## Discuss: Version History, Backup, and Version Control

Some backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also
allows you to recover specific versions.

How is this functionality different from version control?

What are some of the benifits of using version control, Git and Github?

---

## Summary

- `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called `origin` automatically set up.
---
# 9. Conflicting changes

Questions:
- What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else's?

Objectives:
- Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur.
- Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge.

Keypoints:
- Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time.
- The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.

---

## Resolving conflicts

* Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time
* Version control helps us manage
[conflicts]({{ page.root }}/reference/#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}/reference/#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The file
`mars.txt` currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our `planets`
repository:

```bash
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```
???

As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone
else's toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.

---

Let's add a line to one partner's copy only:

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to Wolfman's copy
```

---

and then push the change to GitHub:

```bash
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Adding a line in our home copy"
```

--

```
[master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

--

```bash
git push origin master
```

--

```
Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
   29aba7c..dabb4c8  master -master
```

---

Now let's have the other partner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

```bash
nano mars.txt
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the other copy
```

---

We can commit the change locally:

```bash
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Adding a line in my copy"
```

--

```
[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in my copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

--

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

--

```
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/vlad/planets.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

---

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge]({{ page.root }}/reference/#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.

---

Let's start by pulling:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

--

```
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

---

`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

```bash
cat mars.txt
```

The file contents reads like this:

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
=======
This line added to Wolfman's copy
>>>>>>dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
```

--

Our change—the one in `HEAD`—is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.

Git inserted a separator between the conflicting changes: `=======`

The end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.

(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

---

We can decide exactly how to resolve the conflicting changes:

```bash
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
```

???

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this.

---

To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

```bash
git add mars.txt
git status
```

--

```
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   mars.txt
```

--

```bash
git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
```

--

```
[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub
```

---

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

```
Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 697 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  master -master
```

---

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

```
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2)
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -FETCH_HEAD
Updating dabb4c8..2abf2b1
Fast-forward
 mars.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

---

We get the merged file:

```bash
cat mars.txt
```

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
```

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

???

Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files
instead of storing everything in one large file.
There's another benefit too:
whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file,
the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users
that they ought to clarify who's responsible for what,
or find a way to divide the work up differently.

---

## Exercise: A Typical Work Session

You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a
remote Git repository. During your work session, you take the following
actions, but not in this order:

- *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file `numbers.txt`
- *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
- *Celebrate* your success with beer(s)
- *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
- *Stage changes* to be committed
- *Commit changes* to the local repository

In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances of
conflicts?

---

## Exercise: Solving Conflicts that You Create

Clone the repository created by your instructor.

Add a new file to it,
and modify an existing file (your instructor will tell you which one).

When asked by your instructor,
pull their changes from the repository to create a conflict,
then resolve it.

---

## Exercise: Conflicts on Non-textual files

What does Git do
when there is a conflict in an image or some other non-text file
that is stored in version control?

---

## Summary

- Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same
time.
- The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's
changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.
---
# 10. Communication

Questions:
- How do I communicate with other groups?
- How do I keep track of bugs and ideas?

Objectives:
- Explain the principle of issue tracking
- Introduce git flow, Slack and resources

Keypoints:
- Issues trackers help keep track of bugs and ideas
- Git flow is one way to organise multiple modellers who collaborate on a code base
---

## Communications

Discuss problems in our Slack team `nismod.slack.com`:

- Slack has channels
    - `#helpme` for help on programming, version control etc.
    - `#general` for general discussion
    - `#modelling` for technical discussion of sector models and integration
    - `#development` is mainly filled with notifications from Github
    - `#random` is for anything else
- Integrations with Skype, Github etc.
- Upload files, add snippets of text
- A record of our discussion and decisions

---

## Issues are found in the github repository

![Github repo](../fig/github-issue.png)

---

## The issues tab lists all of the issues

![Issues Page](../fig/github-issue-clicked.png)

---

## Create an issue to record a bug, feature idea or to ask a question

![Create an Issue](../fig/github-issue-enter.png)

## Tag colleagues, add labels, assign someone to work on the bug

???

- Useful descriptive title
- BUG: Steps required to recreate the problem
- FEATURE:

---

## Each issue is referenced with an id number

![Create an Issue](../fig/github-issue-numbered.png)

Reference issues in commit messages

```bash
git commit -m "Fixes bug #25. Added float to variable"
```

---

## Practical: Use issues as part of a work flow

With your neighbour:

1. Create an issue
1. Give it a descriptive title
1. Write the idea in the description
1. Add an appropriate tag
1. Assign it to a milestone or project
1. Assign the issue to your colleague

Swap:

1. Implement the idea
1. Add a reference to the issue in a commit message
1. Submit a pull request
