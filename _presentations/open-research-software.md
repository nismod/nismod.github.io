# Open Research Software

## What is open research software?

We're mainly talking about open-source software, which fits into the wider open
research agenda, including:
- open source code
- open data
- open access publications

In each of these cases, "open" means:
- publicly available
- with an open license, means you are free to:
  - use
  - share, distribute
  - modify
- and typically mean that you must:
  - acknowledge
  - make any modifications freely available too

## Why write and publish open research software?

It's good practice 21st century science:

Research software is a public good - especially if publicly funded:

> research data is a public good produced in the public interest and should be
> made freely and openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a
> timely and responsible manner
>
> &mdash; [Guide to EPSRC policy, Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/how-does-software-fit-epsrcs-research-data-policy)


Potentially enabling better science and policy:
- open data and open code is available for scrutiny
- "many eyes make all bugs shallow"
- leverage point in planning systems (Lovelace et al 2020)

Collaboration and credit:
- get credit, and credit contributors
- avoid reinventing wheels - use open libraries
- enable collaboration - contribute/receive contributions

## How to write, publish and maintain open research software

Practical level
- [Get started with GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/)

Make code citable
- [Software archive with DOI](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- [Software journals](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)

Overview of [Good-enough practices](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
- write a README, document the "why"
- make the license explicit
- keep track of changes in version control
- use version numbers to communicate bigger changes
- be ready to deprecate or mark it as "done"
